# Hate Raid Prevention Tools
Everything posted here is information to help protect your stream.

## Name Filter for Chatbots
If you use **Streamlabs**, check [streamlabs-alert-filters.md](https://github.com/t-affeldt/hate-raid-prevention/blob/main/streamlabs-alert-filters.md) to block common hate raid names from triggering alerts.
Make sure to occasionally check back and update your filter settings as new filters are being added.

If you use **StreamElements**, check [streamelements-name-filters.md](https://github.com/t-affeldt/hate-raid-prevention/blob/main/streamelements-name-filters.md) to automatically ban hate raid accounts.
Make sure to occasionally check back and update your filter settings as new filters are being added.

## Account Name Lists
For a list of **malicious accounts**, check [LinoYeen's](https://github.com/LinoYeen/Namelists) repository.

For a list of **non-malicious bot accounts**, check [friendly-bots.txt](https://github.com/t-affeldt/hate-raid-prevention/blob/main/friendly-bots.txt). This list is designed as a resource for ban tools to prevent false-positives.
